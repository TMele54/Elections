Senate for 46 years, dies of brain cancer at the age of 77 (Aug. 6). A shooting at the Fort
Hood army post in Texas kills 13 and injures 29. Ten of those killed are military personnel.
Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, an army psychiatrist, is charged with 13 counts of premeditated
murder (Nov. 5). A Nigerian man on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit allegedly attempted
to ignite an explosive device hidden in his underwear. The alleged bomber, Umar Farouk
Abdulmutallab, told officials later that he was directed by the terrorist group Al
Qaeda (Dec. 25).

An explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico sends millions
of gallons of oil into the sea. The spill kills 11 and is the largest off-shore spill in U.S.
history as well as one of the largest spills in world history(Jan. 22). The United States
Senate votes 63 to 37 to confirm President Obama's most recent nominee to the U.S.
Supreme Court, Elena Kagan, as the newest Justice. Kagan is only the fourth woman to
ever hold this position, and she'll be the third female member of the current bench, joining
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. Kagan is the former dean of Harvard Law
School; she'll be the only member of the current Supreme Court to have no previous
experience as a judge (Aug. 5). The Senate votes 65 to 31 in favor of repealing Don't Ask,
Don't Tell, the Clinton-era military policy that forbids openly gay men and women from
serving in the military. Eight Republicans side with the Democrats to strike down the ban.
The repeal is sent to President Obama for his final signature. The ban will not be lifted
officially until Obama, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and Admiral Mike Mullen, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, agree that the military is ready to enact the change
and that it won't affect military readiness (Dec. 18).

Arizona Representative Gabrielle Giffords is among 17 shot by a gunman who opened fire
on the congresswoman's constituent meeting outside a local grocery store. The gunman,
who police identify as Jared Lee Loughner, is apprehended (Jan. 8). President Obama
announces his intention to reduce the federal deficit by $400 billion over 10 years. His plan
for enacting this dramatic reduction includes budget cuts and freezes, including a spending
freeze on many domestic programs (Jan. 24). The Obama Administration determines that
the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional. The Justice Department will stop
defending the law in court (Feb. 23). With less than two hours to spare, an agreement on
the federal budget is made, avoiding a government shutdown. Republicans demand a
provision to restrict financing to Planned Parenthood and other groups that provide
abortions. Obama and the Democrats refuse to budge on the abortion provision, but they
do agree to tens of billions in spending cuts (April 1). Legendary Boston crime boss,
James "Whitey" Bulger is found and arrested by federal authorities in Santa Monica, Calif.
Bulger is on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list and has been indicted in 19 murders (June 22).
Congress makes an 11th-hour deal to prevent a national default. The deal raises the debt
ceiling in two steps to $2.4 trillion and cuts an initial $1 trillion in spending over ten
years (Aug. 1). For the first time in history, the U.S. has its credit rating lowered. Credit
agency Standard & Poor's lowered the nation's credit rating from the top grade of AAA to
AA+, removing the U.S. from its list of risk-free borrowers (Aug. 5). The Congressional
Supercommittee in charge of finding $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions fails to agree on what
programs to cut. Therefore, automatic cuts to military and domestic programs will go into
effect in 2013 (Nov. 21).

The Pentagon announces that women will now be permanently assigned to battalions.
Many women already serve in those battalions due to demand in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The new ruling only makes these job assignments official and upholds the ban on women
serving in combat (Feb. 9). Hurricane Sandy causes at least 132 deaths and an estimated
82 billion in damages, making it the second costliest hurricane in the U.S., behind Katrina.
New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut are hardest hit (Oct. 29). President Obama is reelected, narrowly defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Democrats keep their
majority in the Senate. Key victories for the Democrats include a win for Tammy Baldwin in
Wisconsin. Her victory makes her the first openly gay candidate to capture a seat in the
Senate. The Republicans keep the majority in the House of Representatives with 232
seats to 191 for the Democrats (Nov. 6). Adam Lanza, age 20, forces his way into Sandy
Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, and kills 26 people, including 20

children between the ages of six and seven. Then Lanza takes his own life while still inside
the school (Dec. 14).

Multiple bombs explode near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Three people are
killed and more than 170 people are injured (April 15). The Guardian receives information
that reveals that the National Security Agency (NSA) is using PRISM to spy on the web
activities, including email, of U.S. citizens. Through PRISM, a clandestine national security
surveillance program, the NSA has direct access to Facebook, YouTube, Skype, Google,
Apple, Yahoo and other websites (June 6). The Guardian publishes a report on another
NSA tool called Boundless Informant, used by the U.S. government to watch activity in
every country in the world. President Obama confirms the existence of PRISM and its use
to spy on the online activity of U.S. citizens(June 8). Edward Snowden, a former CIA
employee, comes forward and admits that he is the source of the recent NSA leaks (June
9). Congress fails to agree on a budget and pass a spending bill, causing the government
to shut down. The government shutdown forces about 800,000 federal workers off the
job (Oct. 1). The night before the debt ceiling deadline, both the House and Senate
approve a bill to fund the government until January 15, 2014, and raise the debt limit
through February 7, 2014. The bill ends the 16-day government shutdown. It also ends the
Republican standoff with President Obama over the Affordable Care Act (Oct. 16). The
Senate deploys the "nuclear option," voting 52-48 to end the right of the minority to
filibuster executive and judicial branch nominees. The vote is called a monumental, once in
a generation change to Senate procedure (Nov. 21). The first ruling against the NSA
surveillance program is handed down by Judge Richard Leon of Federal District Court for
the District of Columbia. He says the program is "significantly likely" to violate the Fourth
Amendment which addresses protection against unreasonable searches (Dec. 16). Just
days after Judge Leon's ruling, an advisory panel commissioned by President Obama
releases a 300-page report that recommends 46 changes to the NSA surveillance
program (Dec 18).
